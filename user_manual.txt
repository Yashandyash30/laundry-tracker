ARIES Hostel Laundry Tracker

Welcome to our new digital system for managing the shared washing machines. No more climbing stairs just to find them busy!
1. Check & Plan
   Open the Link: https://aries-laundry.streamlit.app

   Status at a Glance:

        Green: Machine is free.

        Red: Machine is busy. The app tells you exactly who is using it and when it will be free (e.g., “Expected: 10:30 PM”).

2. Start Your Wash

    If Free: Load your clothes, select the machine in the app, and click "Start Machine".

    Set Your PIN: Create a simple 4-digit PIN (e.g., 1234).

        Note: You need this PIN to stop the timer or extend time if the power goes out!

3. The Queue

If all machines are busy, click "Join Queue".

    Urgency: If you have an emergency (e.g., no clothes to wear other then that), tick the "🔥 Urgent" box and state your reason.

    The "Pass" System: You cannot cut the line. However, if you see someone behind you has an urgent need, you can choose to let them pass.

        How: Click your name in the queue ➝ Enter YOUR PIN ➝ Click "▼ Swap Down".

        Note: This is voluntary. Helping a friend in need is up to you!

4. Stay Updated

    Browser: Click "Enable Alerts" in the sidebar and keep the tab open for a popup when your machine is ready.

    Telegram: Join the ARIES Laundry Updates group (https://t.me/+69YKX5iyRyM1NzJl) to get instant notifications on your phone even when the app is closed.

5. Troubleshooting

    Power Cut? Go to "Manage" ➝ Enter PIN ➝ "Add Time" (e.g., +15 mins).

    Forgot PIN? Contact Yash (Admin) for a reset.


Important : Time’s Up? Please collect clothes within 15 mins of finish time, or the next person has the right to skip your turn.
